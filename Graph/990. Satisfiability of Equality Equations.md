# 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations

#### Description:

---

You are given an array of strings `equations` that represent relationships between variables where each string `equations[i]` is of length `4` and takes one of two different forms: `"xi==yi"` or `"xi!=yi"`.Here, `xi` and `yi` are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.

Return `true` *if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or* `false` *otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

```Java
Input: equations = ["a==b","b!=a"]
Output: false
Explanation: If we assign say, a = 1 and b = 1, then the first equation is satisfied, but not the second.
There is no way to assign the variables to satisfy both equations.
```



**Example 2:**

```java
Input: equations = ["b==a","a==b"]
Output: true
Explanation: We could assign a = 1 and b = 1 to satisfy both equations.
```

```Java
class Solution {
    public boolean equationsPossible(String[] equations) {
        // at most 26 letters
        UF uf = new UF(26);
        
        // connect a & b if the proposition 'a==b' is given
        for (String pair : equations) {
            int from = pair.charAt(0) - 'a';
            int to = pair.charAt(3) - 'a';
            if (pair.charAt(1) == '=' && !uf.connected(from, to)) uf.union(from, to);
        }
        
        // check equations
        for (String pair : equations) {
            int from = pair.charAt(0) - 'a';
            int to = pair.charAt(3) - 'a';
            if (pair.charAt(1) == '!' && uf.connected(from, to)) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private class UF {
		...
    }
}
```
