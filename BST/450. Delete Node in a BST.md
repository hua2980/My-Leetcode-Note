# 450. Delete Node in a BST

#### Description:

---

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return *the **root node reference**(possibly updated) of the BST*.

Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:

1. Search for a node to remove.
2. If the node is found, delete the node.

**Example 1:**

```Java
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,7], key = 3
Output: [5,4,6,2,null,null,7]
Explanation: Given key to delete is 3. So we find the node with value 3 and delete it.
One valid answer is [5,4,6,2,null,null,7], shown in the above BST.
Please notice that another valid answer is [5,2,6,null,4,null,7] and it's also accepted.
```



#### Discussion

1. Search BST (binary search) and find the target node if `root.val == key`. 

2. Once we find the target node:

* Base case: if the target node has no subtree, delete the node directly

* In case that the target node has one subtree: replace the node with its subtree.

* In case that the target node has more than one subtree: 
  * Step 1: find the successor, which is the node with minimum val in the right subtree.
  * Step 2: delete the successor in the right subtree, replace the target place with the successor. 



Notice: 

the code `if (root == null) return null` is neccessary because there's case where we can't find the target node whose `val` equals to `key`.

```Java
class Solution {
    public TreeNode deleteNode(TreeNode root, int key) {
        if (root == null) return null;
         
        // binary search
        // the key is in the left subtree, delete the target node in the left subtree
        if (root.val > key) root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
        // the key is in the right subtree, delete the target node in the right subtree
        else if (root.val < key) root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
        // if we find the target node
        else {
            // if the node has only one subtree
            if (root.right == null) return root.left;
            if (root.left == null) return root.right;
            
            // find the successor
            TreeNode successor = getMin(root.right);
            // delete the successor in the right subtree
            root.right = deleteNode(root.right, successor.val);
            
            // replace the target root with the successor
            successor.left = root.left;
            successor.right = root.right;
            root = successor;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
    
    private TreeNode getMin(TreeNode root){
        while(root.left != null) root = root.left;
        return root;
    }
}
```
