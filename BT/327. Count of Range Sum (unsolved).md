#### Description:

---

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return *the number of range sums that lie in* `[lower, upper]` *inclusive*.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i <= j`.

**Example 1:**

```Java
Input: nums = [-2,5,-1], lower = -2, upper = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The three ranges are: [0,0], [2,2], and [0,2] and their respective sums are: -2, -1, 2.
```
